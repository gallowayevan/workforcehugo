* Of the 436 NC medical school graduates from the class of 2012, 1% (n=4) were in practice in primary care in rural NC five years after graduation.  This finding is similar to prior years.
* All four physicians in primary care practice in a rural county were family medicine physicians who graduated from a public medical school: two each from East Carolina University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.
* Primary care includes family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, internal medicine-pediatrics, and obstetrics & gynecology.
