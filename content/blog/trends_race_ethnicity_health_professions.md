{{< takeaway >}}
* We examined trends in the racial/ethnic diversity of health workforce in North Carolina using the Health Professions Data System’s (HPDS) licensure data from 2009-2022.
* The racial/ethnic diversity of the health workforce of North Carolina has increased over time but continues to fall short of the State’s racial/ethnic demographics for most professions.
* Though new graduates are more racially/ethnically diverse than the current workforce, they have not yet significantly increased the diversity of NC’s health workforce. 
* The proportion of missing racial/ethnic data has increased substantially across several health professions since 2018. Thus, we may be losing our ability to accurately describe the diversity of the NC healthcare workforce.

We examined how four of the North Carolina health professions'
(physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and optometrists) diversity changed
over time between 2009 and 2022. We compare the diversity of current NC
practitioners (physicians, dentists, and pharmacists) with recent
graduates (2017-2021). We also describe the racial/ethnic diversity of
physicians and dentists that practice in NC that were educated in NC
compared to those educated out-of-state.

### How has the racial/ethnic diversity of selected NC health professions changed over time?

We examined if the racial/ethnic diversity of four professions
(physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and optometrists) changed over
time across a 12-year time period (2009, 2014, 2019 and 2022)
(_Figures 1a-d_).

-   Each profession experienced an increase in the proportion of
    practitioners in at least two racial/ethnic categories between 2009
    and 2022

-   However, there were minimal increases in the racial/ethnic diversity
    of NC physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and optometrists between
    2009 and 2022

-   There was an increase of at least 4 percentage points in physicians,
    dentists, pharmacists, and optometrists who identified as Asian
    /Pacific Islander between 2009 and 2022

-   There was no increase in the proportion individuals in the physician
    workforce who identified as Hispanic, and a small increase in the
    proportion of dentists, pharmacists, and optometrists who identified
    as Hispanic

-   The proportion of practitioners who identified as Black/African
    American increased by 1 or more percentage point across all four
    professions

*Physicians*. The percentage of NC physicians who identified as
Black/African American increased from 7% in 2009 to 8% in 2014 and
remained constant at 8% across 2019 and 2022. Trends in Hispanic
representation of the physician workforce remained consistent over the
studied years at 3%. The percentage of NC physicians who identified as
Asian/Pacific Islander increased across 2009 (10%), 2014 (12%), 2019
(14%) and 2022 (16%). Across all available years less than or equal to
0.5% of NC physicians identified as American Indian/Alaska Native. The
percentage of NC physicians who identified as Multiracial/Other peaked
in 2014 (2%), then fell to 1% in 2019 and 2022, matching the proportion
in 2009.

*Dentists*. The percentage of NC dentists who identified as
Black/African American increased from 8% in 2009 to 9% in 2014 and
remained at 9% in both 2019 and 2022. The percentage of NC dentists who
identified as Hispanic increased from 1% in 2009 to 2% in 2014 and
remained at 2% in both 2019 and 2022. The percentage of NC dentists who
identified as Multiracial/Other remained at 0% from 2009 to 2022. The
percentage of NC dentists who identified as Asian/Pacific Islander
increased from 4% in 2009 to 7% in 2014, 10% in 2019 and 11% in 2022.
The NC Dental board does not collect data on the American Indian/Alaska
Native racial/ethnic identity and the representation of American
Indian/Alaska Native dentists in NC is unknown.

*Pharmacists*. The percentage of NC pharmacists who identified as
Black/African American increased across 2009 (5%), 2014 (6%) and 2019
(7%) and remained constant in at 7% in 2022. The percentage of NC
pharmacists who identified as Hispanic remained constant at ≤1% across
all selected years. The percentage of NC pharmacists who identified as
Multiracial/Other increased over time from \<1% in 2009 and 2014 to 1%
in 2019 and 2% in 2022. The percentage of NC pharmacists who identified
as Asian/Pacific Islander was at its highest in 2022 at 10%, increasing
from 6% in 2009, 8% in 2014, and 9% in 2019. The percentage of NC
pharmacists who identified as American Indian/Alaska Native increased
from 0.5% in 2009 to 1% in 2014 and remained at 1% in 2019 and 2022.

*Optometrists*. The percentage of NC optometrists who identified as
Black/African American increased from 2% in 2009 and 2014 to 3% in 2019
and remained at 3% in 2022. The percentage of NC optometrists who
identified as Hispanic remained constant at 1% across 2014, 2019 and
2022, increasing from 0.5% in 2009. The percentage of NC optometrists
who identified as Multiracial/Other increased from 0.1% in 2009, 0.3% in
2014, 0.7% in 2019 to 1% in 2022. The percentage of NC optometrists who
identified as Asian/Pacific Islander increased from 3% in 2009, 5% in
2014, 7% in 2019 to 8% in 2022. The percentage of NC optometrists who
identified as American Indian/Alaska Native remained ≤1% across 2014,
2019 and 2022.

### What is the racial/ethnic composition of new health profession graduates?

We examined the racial/ethnic diversity of recent (2017-2021) graduates
of NC health professions educational programs to assess possible future
trends of the NC health workforce. Using data from the Fitzhugh Mullen
Institute Health Workforce Diversity Tracker showed that recent
graduates (2017-2021) of physician, pharmacist, and dental programs in
North Carolina are almost all more diverse than the 2022 active NC
workforce in the professions included in this analysis.[^1] The Diversity
Tracker uses three categories for race/ethnicity including Black,
Hispanic, and Asian[^1] with no information on American Indian or
Multiracial groups (*Figure 2*).

*Physicians*. Of the recent graduates of NC schools of medicine between
2017 and 2022, 8% identified as Black which is the same as the 2022
physician workforce in NC (8%).[^1] This suggests that there is not an
increasing proportion of medical school graduates that identify as
Black/African American that will increase the diversity of the future
physician workforce. There were more recent graduates of NC schools of
medicine that identified as Hispanic than in the current NC physician
workforce (5% vs. 3%), however, this increase is not representative of
the 11% of the State's population that identified as Hispanic.[^1][^2] Of
the recent NC graduates from schools of medicine, 19% of new NC
graduates identified as Asian as compared to 15% of 2022 NC physicians
and 4% of the 2022 NC population who identified as Asian/Pacific
Islander.[^1][^2]

*Dentists*. Of the recent graduates of NC dental schools between 2017
and 2022, 6% identified as Hispanic and 14% identified as Black,
compared 2% of NC dentists in 2022 that identify as Hispanic and to 9%
who identified as Black[^1]. This finding suggests that there was a
higher proportion of dental school graduates that identified as Black
and Hispanic than the current workforce, however these increases do not
yet reflect the racial/ethnic diversity of the State in 2022. There were
11% of NC dentists in 2022 that identified as Asian compared to 10% of
NC dental graduates between 2017 and 2022[^1], compared to 4% of the 2022
NC population.[^1][^2]

*Pharmacists.* Of the recent graduates of NC pharmacy schools between
2017 and 2022, 4% identified as Hispanic and 11% identified as Black,
compared 1% of NC pharmacists in 2022 that identified as Hispanic and to
7% who identified as Black/African American.[^1] This finding suggests
that there is a higher proportion of pharmacy school graduates that
identified as Black/African American and Hispanic than the current
workforce, however these increases do not yet reflect the racial/ethnic
diversity of the State in 2022. Of the recent NC graduates from pharmacy
schools, 14% of new NC graduates identified as Asian which is a higher
proportion of current NC pharmacists who identify as Asian (10%).[^1]

### What proportion of the health professionals who are racially/ethnically diverse are educated in North Carolina?

We examined trends in the proportion of physicians and dentists in
active practice in North Carolina in 2022, by race/ethnicity, who were
educated in North Carolina versus out-of-state (*Figure 3-4*).

*Physicians*. The majority of physicians licensed to practice in NC in
2022 attended medical school in North Carolina (86% out-of-state vs. 14%
in-state). As such, across all racial/ethnic groups there were more
individuals educated out-of-state than within North Carolina. For
example, 16% of Black/African American, 9% of Hispanic, 9% of
Asian/Pacific Islander, 13% Multiracial/Other and 16% of White
physicians who are licensed to practice in NC in 2022 were educated in
NC. However, about half (48%, n=48) of physicians who identified as
American Indian/Alaska Native were educated in-state---close to 3 times
higher than any other racial/ethnic group. These findings reflect that
although recent graduates of NC medical schools are increasingly from
diverse racial/ethnic groups the majority of racial/ethnic diverse
physicians are educated out-of-state.

*Dentists.* A significantly greater proportion of dentists who practice
in NC in 2022 were educated in NC compared to physicians. In 2022,
approximately 44% of dentists in active practice in NC graduated from an
in-state dental school. There were some differences across racial/ethnic
groups. For example, 39% of active NC dentists who identified as
Black/African American were educated out-of-state as compared to 61% of
those educated in-state. Similarly, 26% of active NC dentists who
identified as Hispanic were educated in NC as compared to 74% educated
outside of NC. However, 48% of NC dentists who identified as White were
educated in NC as compared to 52% trained out-of-state. Of active NC
dentists in 2022, those who were educated outside of North Carolina are
more diverse than those educated in-state.

### Conclusion
Although the North Carolina population is increasingly racially/ethnically diverse, most of the NC health professions included in this report are not representative of the State population. Some professions have had small increases in the proportion of individuals who are racially/ethnically diverse between 2009 and 2022, yet other professions have had no increases or experienced decreases in the diversity of the workforce. The majority of health professionals studied in this report are educated out-of-state, as such most of the racial/ethnic diverse health professionals are also educated out-of-state. 
The data included in this brief are derived from the North Carolina HPDS which has collected data on the demographic characteristics of the licensed health workforce for over 40 years. Evidence supports that a racially/ethnically diverse health workforce that is representative of the community they serve improves health outcomes.[^3][^4][^5] Tracking trends in the data are critical to help inform policy makers, educators, employers, and others who are interested in recruiting and retaining a workforce that meets population health needs in North Carolina. 


### *Trends in racial/ethnicity data: missing over time*

One concerning observation from these data is the increase in missing
data related to the race/ethnicity of the health workforce since 2018.
In 2022, 6.3% (n=1,695) of the total physicians in the state are missing
their associated racial/ethnic data, along with 3% (n=176) of the
state's total dentists. Missing racial/ethnic data limits our ability to
monitor trends and develop policy to recruit and retain a workforce that
represents the racial and ethnic diversity of North Carolina's
population. Another limitation of these data are the differences in how
NC health professions boards collect racial/ethnic data, with varying
question types, categories and question structures which can make
comparing racial/ethnic data across professions and over time difficult.
Lastly, in some cases, ethnicity is separated from race while in other
racial/ethnic categories are offered together in one question. The data
in this brief provide a description of race/ethnicity based on the data
that are available and self-reported to the professional board by
licensees. To observe trends in missing data for race/ethnicity in HPDS
