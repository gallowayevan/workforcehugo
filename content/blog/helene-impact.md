 In September 2024, Hurricane Helene devastated many counties in North
 Carolina (NC), especially those in the western part of the state. The
 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated Hurricane Helene
 disaster areas in 28 North Carolina (NC) counties, making them
 eligible to apply for individual and public assistance for both
 emergency work (to be completed within six months) and permanent work
 (to be completed within 18 months) (these counties are indicated by
 ![Example of crosshatched shading.](/images/posts/helene/disaster_shading.png) shading in Figure 1). In this blog,
 we examine the health care workers located in areas impacted by
 Helene. We also provide an overview of regulatory waivers implemented
 by the state and licensure boards in response to the hurricane.

 ### What was the 2023 health workforce supply in the 28 NC counties prior to Hurricane Helene?

-   Among the 21 NC healthcare professions within the [NC Health
    Professions Data System
    (HPDS)](https://nchealthworkforce.unc.edu/interactive/supply/), 36,849 (15.5%) of the state's clinicians were employed in
    Hurricane Helene FEMA designated disaster areas (Table 1).

-   Registered nurses (RNs) comprised almost half of the actively
    practicing healthcare professionals in designated disaster areas
    (n=17,660, 47.9%) (Table 1).

-   The physician workforce represented 10.5% (n=3,872) of healthcare
    professionals in designated disaster areas (Table 1).

-   The top five professions with the greatest percentage of their
    workforce in designated disaster areas included: physical therapy
    assistants (n=755, 25.2%), occupational therapy assistants (n=480,
    22.8%), the chiropractor workforce (n=452, 20.4%), certified nurse
    midwives (73, 18.7%), and dental hygienists (n=1,187, 17.9%) (Table
    1).

### What was the 2023 health workforce supply in the 28 NC counties compared to population?

Most counties in designated disaster areas were underserved compared to
state averages in 2023. The devastation of Hurricane Helene may cause
additional shortages of healthcare professionals if clinicians are
unable to return to active practice in previous practice locations.

-   More than half of health professions in the HPDS (12 professions,
    57.1%) had fewer health professionals per 10,000 (10k) population in
    practice in effected areas compared to the state rate of
    professionals per 10k population (Table 2, Figure 2).

-   In three counties (Macon, Graham, and Caldwell), 20 of the 21 health
    professions had clinician to 10k population rates less than the
    state rate (Figure 2).

-   Buncombe county was the only county in effected areas in which all
    health professions represented by the HPDS had a clinician to 10k
    population rate greater than the state rate (Figure 3).

-   Registered nurses and physicians represent the two largest
    healthcare workforces in NC and therefore it is not surprising that
    these two workforces had the largest percentage of healthcare
    professionals in designated disaster areas. Given that some of the
    smaller healthcare workforces had a larger percentage of their
    professions in the disaster areas per 10k population compared with
    state rates (Table 2), we will monitor the potential decline in
    number of these smaller professionals post-Helene for impact to
    these workforces and the services they provide to the region.

The potential for increased clinician shortages in post-Helene disaster
areas will be met with a heightened need for care in effected
communities. The types of care needed after a hurricane vary depending
on the amount of time elapsed since the event, especially regarding
impacts related to storm-associated
[flooding](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/67/9/1450/4945455).
Immediate care required may have included responding to
[trauma](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44807703_Health_Impacts_of_Floods)s,
drowning and hypothermia. The onset of infections during subsequent time
after the event may require a different mix of health care
professionals. Care in the longer-term will include responding to
healthcare needs of the population related to routine physical health,
mental health, oral health care, and management of chronic diseases.
Thus, monitoring changes in the supply of all healthcare professionals
in areas impacted by Hurricane Helene is essential.

### How might state and regulatory board policies address issues in workforce supply?

Anticipating the impact of Tropical Storm Helene to the state, North
Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a statewide state of emergency
through [Executive Order (EO)
315](https://governor.nc.gov/executive-order-no-315/open) on September
25, 2024. On October 5, 2024, [EO
318](https://governor.nc.gov/executive-order-no-318/open) was issued to
respond to recovery needs and relief efforts related to the impact of
Hurricane Helene. Section 1(A) of EO 318 granted health care licensure
boards the authority to create regulatory waivers, within certain
criteria, to increase the supply of healthcare workers available to
provide services during the declared state of emergency (SOE). [NC
Session Law (SL)
2024-51](https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/House/PDF/H149v5.pdf)
created The Disaster Recovery Act of 2024 which was modified by [SL
2024-53](https://ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/Senate/PDF/S743v5.pdf),
The Disaster Recovery Act of 2024-Part II. Section 4B.3.(a) of SL
2024-53 also included additional waivers to NC healthcare clinician
regulations. Section4E.1.(a)--(f) of the law authorized state agencies
to exercise regulatory flexibility for employment-related
certifications.

A review of NC occupational licensing board websites suggests six of the
eleven boards in the HPDS implemented regulatory waivers in response to
the Hurricane Helene SOE (Table 3). Regulatory waivers vary by
profession and include one or more provisions to allow healthcare
professionals to reenter practice or to practice with modifications to
normal regulatory restrictions during the declared SOE. Some of these
provisions include:

-   waivers related to specific sections of collaborative practice
    agreements and/or quality improvement meetings and related
    documentation for advanced practice clinicians who require physician
    supervision to practice

-   emergency limited licenses for out-of-state professionals to
    practice in NC during the SOE

-   emergency reinstatement for retired/inactive licensees to reenter
    the workforce and provide care during the SOE

-   authorization for relocation of pharmacies as needed to provide
    continued operations

-   authorization for a one-time emergency refill for prescriptions

 In addition to regulatory waivers for practice, the NC Medical Board
 website includes a resource that identifies medical practices in
 western NC in operation after the hurricane and the NC Board of
 Pharmacy website includes a resource with open pharmacies in effected
 areas (Table 3). These examples are not all-inclusive of regulatory
 waivers enacted during the emergency. Regulatory waivers vary in
 content and length of time before expiration depending on the
 profession and regulatory board.
