In this data brief, we used North Carolina state licensure data from the Health Professions Data System (HPDS) to explore the racial/ethnic diversity of selected health professions (physicians, dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses [LPNs], physical therapists [PTs], occupational therapists [OTs]) in North Carolina. We examined how the racial/ethnic diversity of each licensed profession in 2022 compares to the state population in 2022. Findings are presented in **Figure 1**.
