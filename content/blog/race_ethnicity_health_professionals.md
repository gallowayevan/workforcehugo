* This data brief describes trends in the racial/ethnic diversity of North Carolina’s health workforce using licensure data from the North Carolina Health Professions Data System’s (HPDS) from 2022.
* In 2022, 21% of NC’s population identified as Black, 11% Hispanic, 4% Multiracial/Other, 4% Asian/Pacific Islander, 2% American Indian/Alaska Native.
* The racial/ethnic diversity of the North Carolina health workforce is not representative of the State’s racial/ethnic demographics for most professions.

In this data brief, we used North Carolina state licensure data from the Health Professions Data System (HPDS) to explore the racial/ethnic diversity of selected health professions (physicians, dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses [LPNs], physical therapists [PTs], occupational therapists [OTs]) in North Carolina. We examined how the racial/ethnic diversity of each licensed profession in 2022 compares to the state population in 2022.[^1] Findings are presented in _Figure 1_.

_Physicians._ Physicians had the highest percentage of individuals who identify as Asian/Pacific Islander (15%) compared to 4% of the NC population, followed by 8% of physicians who identified as Black/African American, compared to 21% of the population. Less than 3% of physicians identified as Hispanic (3%), Multiracial/Other (1%) and American Indian (<0.5%). 

_Dentists._ There was an over representation of dentists who identified as Asian practicing in North Carolina relative to the population identifying as Asian in the State (11% vs 4% respectively). There was an under representation of dentists who identified as Black (9%), Hispanic (2%), and there were no reported Dentists who identified as Multiracial/Other. The NC Dental board does not collect data on American Indian/Alaska Native racial/ethnic identity and the representation of American Indian/Alaska Native dentists in NC is unknown. 

_Pharmacists._ There was a higher proportion of pharmacists that identify as Asian/Pacific Islander than the NC population (10% vs. 4%). However, pharmacists were underrepresented for all other racial/ethnic groups including Black/African American (7% vs. 21%), Multiracial/other (2% vs. 4%), Hispanic (1% vs. 11%), and American Indian (0.6% vs. 2%). 

_Optometrists._ Optometrists had the lowest percentage of individuals who identify as Black/African American (3%) among the eight professions studied. Less than 3% of the Optometrist workforce in the State identified as Hispanic (1%), American Indian (1%), and Multiracial/Other (1%). However, there were proportionally more Optometrists who identify as Asian (9%) than in the NC population (4%).

_RNs._ Of all licensed RNs in the State in 2022, 12% were Black/African American. Less than 9% of RNs identified as either Asian/Pacific Islander (4%), Hispanic (3%), American Indian/Alaska Native (1%), and Multiracial/Other (1%). RNs matched the State population proportion of individuals who identity as Asian/Pacific Islander (4%). 

_LPNs._ LPNs had a higher proportion of individuals who identified as Black/African American when compared to the State population: 34% of LPNs identified as Black/African American compared to 21% of the state population. LPNs had the largest percentage of individuals who identified as American Indian/Alaska Native (2%) compared to all seven other professions and matched the state population (2%). LPNs had the lowest percentage of individuals who identified as Asian/Pacific Islander (1%) compared to the other professions and the State (4%). 

_PTs._ PTs had a lower proportion of individuals who identified as Multiracial/Other (2%) than the state population (4%). There was a higher proportion of PTs that identified as Asian/Pacific Islander compared to the NC population (7% vs. 4%). Less than 6% of PTs identified as Black (4%), Hispanic (2%), or American Indian (<0.5%).

_OTs._ OTs fell short of matching the proportions of the State in all racial/ethnic categories. Less than 15% of OTs identified as Black/African American (7%), Asian/Pacific Islander (3%), Hispanic (2%), Multiracial/Other (2%), and American Indian (<0.5%).
