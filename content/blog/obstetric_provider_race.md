* In 2018, 21% of NC's population identified as black or African American, compared to 13% of the state's obstetric delivery providers.
* Similarly, 10% of NC's population identified as Hispanic or Latino in 2018, compared to 3% of NC's obstetric delivery providers.
* Additionally, only five black family medicine physicians reported providing routine obstetric delivery services in 2018.
* In North Carolina, infant mortality rates are higher for non-Hispanic black babies than for non-Hispanic white babies, and this gap has persisted for nearly 20 years. \[1] In 2018, black infants were almost two and a half times more likely to die than white infants. \[2, 3]
* Relative to white patients, black patients report worse communication and lower shared decision-making with physicians. \[4] Racial concordance, when patients and physicians identify as the same race, is associated with better patient-physician communication.  Training can help improve communication between non-racially concordant providers and patients.
