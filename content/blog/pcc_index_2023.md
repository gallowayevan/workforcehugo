Since 2017, Sheps Health Workforce NC has produced a primary care clinician index to measure geographic access to primary care at the county level. The index is an adjusted ratio of population to primary care clinician, so a higher value suggests worse access to primary care services. A ratio of 1500 people to 1 primary care clinician or less can indicate a sufficient number of primary care clinicians in an area. However, even in area that falls below the 1500:1 threshold, individuals can often experience difficulty in obtaining primary care services, as a result of socioeconomic barriers. 

Below is an animated map showing the change to the index over time, where light blue indicates a possibly sufficient supply. Many counties have seen improved spatial or geographic access to primary care during this period. Anson County stands out as a county that has greatly increased the number of primary care clinicians.

## Primary Care Clinician Index by County, North Carolina 2017-2023

{{< img alt="Map showing the change in the primary care clinician index between 2017 and 2023 at the county level for North Carolina. Overall, counties appear to be trending towards lower index values, implying greater spatial access to primary care."   src="/images/posts/pcc_index_2017-2023_lower_res.webp">}}

Here is a map showing the change over time as a percentage. For instance, Wake County is light blue because the county's primary care clinician index decreased by 20% between 2017 and 2023, indicating improved geographic access to care.

{{< img alt="A map of North Carolina showing the counties of North Carolina where the color of each county indicates the percentage change in the primary care clinician index between 2017 and 2023.

But what is a primary care clinician? For this index, we consider physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and certified nurse midwives as potential providers of primary care. (You can read more details of the methodology below.) The next chart illustrates the components of change for the index.

These component maps illustrate that, for example, primary care nurse practitioners have grown in most areas of the state, and that clinician supply in fast fast-growing counties, like Brunswick and Johnston, has kept pace with population growth. 

<small>Notes: Primary care physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners are defined as in Spero JC & Galloway EM. (2019) [Running the Numbers.](https://ncmedicaljournal.com/article/55138) North Carolina Medical Journal, 80(3), 186-190. Physicians with a primary area of practice of obstetrics/gynecology were weighted as 0.25 of a full-time equivalent (FTE) primary care practitioner. All other primary care physicians were weighted as 1 FTE. Primary care physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives were weighted as 0.75 FTE. Physician and physician assistant data are derived from licensure data provided by the North Carolina Medical Board. This analysis only includes physicians who are not residents-in-training and are not employed by the Federal government. Nurse practitioner and certified nurse midwife data is derived from licensure data provided by the North Carolina Board of Nursing. Data include active, licensed practitioners in practice in North Carolina as of October 31 of each year. Practitioners are assigned to counties based on primary practice location. County populations were adjusted for age and gender according to primary care use rates described in data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The raw (unadjusted) population data was from the [NC Office of State Budget and Management](https://www.osbm.nc.gov/demog/county-projections). The methods are substantially the same as and are described in more detail in this paper: Zolotor AJ, Galloway E, Beal M & Fraher EP. (2022) [Primary Care Clinicians in Low-Access Counties.](https://ncmedicaljournal.com/article/55438) North Carolina Medical Journal, 83(3), 163â€“68.</small>
