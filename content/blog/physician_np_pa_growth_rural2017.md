* The total number of NPs and PAs in North Carolina is less than the number of physicians, but new NPs and PAs are entering NC's workforce faster than physicians are.
* The NP workforce has grown the most rapidly of the three, with growth in non-metropolitan (rural) counties keeping pace with that of metropolitan (urban) counties.
* In recent years, the rate of growth for PAs and physicians has been greater in urban counties.
