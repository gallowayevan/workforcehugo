* The total number of NPs and PAs in North Carolina is less than the number of physicians, but new NPs and PAs are entering NC's workforce faster than physicians are.
* Between 2000 and 2017, the NP workforce grew most rapidly, increasing by 216% in non-rural counties and by 187% in rural counties.
* After 2014, the gap in workforce growth between non-rural and rural counties widened for both physicians and PAs.
* For more background and information, see [this article](http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/content/80/3/186.full) in the North Carolina Medical Journal.
