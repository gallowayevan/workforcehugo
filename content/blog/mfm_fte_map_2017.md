* Maternal and fetal medicine is a subspecialty of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Ob-Gyn) focused on high-risk or complicated pregnancies.  "High-risk" means the mother or fetus is at risk of problems during pregnancy or delivery due to a chronic disease, an infection, problems with previous pregnancies, a pregnancy-related health condition like preeclampsia, or another reason.
* As with many subspecialties, maternal and fetal medicine physicians tend to concentrate in urban areas, near hospitals and academic health centers. They may expand the reach of their services through telemedicine services and consultations with a patient's primary Ob-Gyn.
