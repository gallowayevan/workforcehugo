**The [NC Health Supply Data Dashboard](https://nchealthworkforce.unc.edu/interactive/supply/) has been recently updated with 2024 data.**

This blog presents select findings from the 2024 data and includes an overview of changes to physician, oral health, pharmacy, and nursing workforces in active practice in North Carolina (NC). We also highlight a recent change to the [HPDS supply visualization tool](https://nchealthworkforce.unc.edu/interactive/supply/), which now allows users to track changes in both certified nurse midwives who practice under a collaborative practice agreement with physicians and those who are independently practicing in the state (see our [last blog](https://nchealthworkforce.unc.edu/blog/cnm-growth/) for more information on the recent legislative changes). 

## Physicians

- The physician workforce increased by 24.5% (23,063 to 28,709) between 2014 and 2024 while the NC population grew 11.2% (from 9,881,906 to 10,984,106) during the same period. The ratio of physicians to NC population grew 12%, from 23.3 physicians per 10,000 (10k) population to 26.1 per 10k population.
- Table 1 shows growth from 2014 to 2024 for the 10 physician specialties with the largest headcount in 2024. Among these specialties, hospitalists had the highest percentage increase (68%). Also notable was the 32.2% increase in family medicine physicians.
    - A recent primary care clinician blog showed that the ratio of primary care clinicians (including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and certified nurse midwives) to the population in the state improved between 2017 to 2023, but cautioned that individuals may still experience difficulty in obtaining primary care services as a result of other factors (e.g. socioeconomic factors, lack of insurance).
- A concerning trend is the slow growth in general pediatricians over the last 10 years, which has not kept pace with the growth in the NC population. North Carolina has experienced a slight decline in general pediatricians per capita, from 1.62 to 1.58 general pediatricians per 10k population between 2014 and 2024.
- There were 1,568 psychiatrists in active practice in the state in 2024, an increase of 25.9% since 2014 (psychiatry specialties include child & adolescent psychiatry, pediatrics - psychiatry, addiction medicine, addiction psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, hypnosis, internal medicine - psychiatry, psychiatry, psychiatry - family practice, psychoanalysis, and psychosomatic medicine). Relative to population, the ratio of psychiatrists per 10k population increased from 1.26 to 1.43 between 2014 and 2024. Psychiatry specialties remain maldistributed across NC, with 25 counties in 2024 having no psychiatrists who reported a primary practice location within the county, which can limit access to mental health care for rural and underserved populations (Figure 1).
