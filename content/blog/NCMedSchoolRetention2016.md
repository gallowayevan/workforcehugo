* The Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University has a legislatively mandated mission: to increase the supply of primary care physicians to serve North Carolina.  Only North Carolina applicants are considered for admission to ECU.
* Consistent with this mission, a higher proportion of ECUâ€™s graduates practice in-state compared to other NC medical schools.
* The language in the mission of each medical school is aligned with the relative proportion of graduates who practice in NC.
