* North Carolina has nine NP schools and eleven PA schools, with a twelfth PA program at Pfieffer University scheduled to open in January 2020.  
  * Including Pfieffer University, seven of the PA programs opened in 2011 or later.
* As part of their education, NP and PA students complete rotations at clinical sites with preceptors: experienced NPs, PAs, and physicians who supervise and mentor learners.  
  * The number of qualified preceptors has not kept pace with the rapid enrollment increases at NP and PA schools, creating a difficult situation for NP and PA programs across NC.
* For more information, see this [NCMJ article ](http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/content/80/3/186.full)and this [brief](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/workforce_product/the-physician-assistant-workforce-in-north-carolina/).
