Where did NC dentists go? 
- NC has moved up in national rankings of dentists per capita, from [37th in 2017 to 24th in 2021](https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/health-policy-institute/dentist-workforce). 
- Most of the dentist growth in the state occurred in 5 counties already well-supplied with dentists: Durham, Guilford, Mecklenburg, Pitt, and Wake. Another 90 counties gained only 20% of new dentists despite representing 60% of NCâ€™s population.
