## Introduction

 The lack of robust, state-level data on the Advanced Practice
 Registered Nurse (APRN) workforce makes understanding gaps in supply
 and demand challenging. To address this gap, an interprofessional team
 of researchers investigated trends in the demographic, education,
 practice and geographic characteristics of the four APRN roles in
 NC -- Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs),
 Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) and Clinical Nurse
 Specialists (CNSs). The
 [**report**](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Final-Public-APRN-State-of-the-State-Report-1.pdf),
 detailing findings from the study, is the culmination of work
 undertaken by the [Cecil G. Sheps Center's Program on Health Workforce
 Research and
 Policy](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/workforce/sign-e-news/)
 with funding from the [North Carolina Board of Nursing
 (NCBON)](https://www.ncbon.com/).

 The study is timely as the state considers ways to address the growing
 demand for health care services and better understand the roles that
 APRNs play in meeting this demand. The report will also be useful to
 provide policy makers with empirical data on APRNs as discussions of
 APRN-related legislation continue.

 ## What makes the North Carolina APRN Report Unique?

 Most APRN studies are at the national level, and while some
 state-level APRN studies exist, they often rely on surveys and suffer
 from low response rates that may produce results that are not
 representative of the true population of APRNs. This study used
 licensure data from the NCBON, which represent a full census of the
 APRN workforce in NC.

## Key Findings

-   The NP workforce in NC grew by 429% between 2000 and 2022, compared
    to a 28% growth rate for physicians over the same period. However,
    there were still more than twice as many physicians as NPs in NC in
    2022 (Figure 1).

 ### Figure 1. Cumulative Percentage Growth of North Carolina Nurse Practitioners, Physicians, Physician Assistants: 2000 - 2022

{{< img alt="This line chart shows the percentage growth of three healthcare professions over time - Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant, and Physician. The Nurse Practitioner line experiences the most rapid growth increasing over 400% from 2000 to 2022. Physician Assistant growth is also substantial at around 200% over the same period, while Physician growth is more modest at around 30%."  src="/images/posts/aprn/figure_1.jpg">}}

<small>**Note**. Data from 2020 and 2021 are unavailable because of issues with
the data which make longitudinal comparisons misleading.</small>

-   In 2022, more than half of new NPs entering the workforce each year
    were from out-of-state (59.6%), moving to NC after completing their
    NP education or from practice in other states.

-   In 2022, 72.9% of the NP workforce in nonmetropolitan communities
    were Family Nurse Practitioners (FNPs).

-   Physicians outnumber NPs and physician assistants (PAs) in NC
    nonmetropolitan counties, but NPs and PAs make up a growing
    percentage of the clinical workforce in nonmetropolitan counties
    (Figure 2).

### Figure 2. North Carolina Nurse Practitioners as a Percentage of Nonmetropolitan Clinicians in the State, 2000-2022

{{< img alt="This stacked bar chart chart shows the proportion of non-metro clinicians from 2000 to 2022 belonging to the following three professions: Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, and Physicians. Generally, the proportion of nurse practitioners has increased substantially, while the proportion of physicians has decreased."  src="/images/posts/aprn/figure_2.png">}}

 <small>**Note**. Clinicians are defined as nurse practitioners (NPs),
 physicians, and physician assistants (PAs). Physician data from 2020
 and 2021 were unavailable because of data collection issues during the
 pandemic. Nonmetropolitan county status was defined using US Office of
 Management and Budget Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs).
 Nonmetropolitan counties include micropolitan counties and non-CBSAs.
 The definition of nonmetropolitan corresponds with the delineations in
 place for each year of data.</small>

  

-   FNPs comprised the largest percentage (28%) of NPs working in
    hospital settings in 2022.

-   The number of psychiatric NPs in the state increased 300% between
    2014 and 2022.

-   The number of psychiatric NPs who identified as underrepresented
    minorities (URMs) increased from 23 to 140 between 2014 and 2022, a
    508% growth rate.

-   In 2022, 50% of FNPs with a dual certification held a second
    certification as a psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner. 

-   The CNM workforce in NC grew by 53% between 2014 and 2022, a number
    that may increase even more in the future given the new pathway to
    independent practice for CNMs in NC.

-   In 2022, 27% of CNMs who identified as URMsworked in nonmetropolitan
    counties, compared to 12% of non-URM CNMs.

-   The CRNA workforce increased at a slower rate than NPs and CNMs from
    2018 to 2022. Also, in contrast to other APRN groups, most CRNAs
    enter practice in NC from in-state pathways (68.1% in 2022).

-   The annual in-state retention of NC CRNA program graduates varied
    widely per program per year between 2019 and 2022 (from 30% to 92%).

-   Most NC counties (n=60) did not have CNSs, and most CNSs practiced
    in metropolitan counties with major health systems/hospitals in
    2022.
