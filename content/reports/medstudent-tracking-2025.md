## Executive Summary

In 1993, the General Assembly mandated an annual report on the number of North Carolina (NC) medical school graduates going into primary care. Since 1994, the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (“Sheps Center”) andthe NC Area Health Education Centers program (AHEC) have collaborated to produce this report which tracks the number of students practicing primary care in rural NC five years after graduation from an NC medical school. As a result of the legislative mandate, NC is a national model for tracking medical student outcomes.

As in prior years, this report tracks NC medical school graduate outcomes for physicians who practice in NC and in rural NC counties. This report includes all five medical schools in North Carolina, both public and private. The Campbell School of Osteopathic Medicine graduated its first class in 2017, so they are not included in the 2014 cohort. This report also includes an analysis of the number of medical school graduates that practice in NC safety net settings[^1] that deliver care to uninsured, Medicaid, and other vulnerable populations, a description in Appendix A of each medical school’s efforts to increase the number of graduates practicing primary care in rural NC and a description in Appendix B of on-going efforts to establish a defined “Pathway to Primary Care” in NC.

Historically, this report examined NC medical school graduates five years following graduation per the legislative mandate. However, this period is not ideal because the time required to complete residency after medical school graduation ranges from three to more than six years. At five-years post-graduation from medical school, physicians in psychiatry, obstetrics & gynecology (ob/gyn), surgery, and medicine/pediatrics are just completing residency, or may be in fellowship/specialty training, and may not have settled in a permanent practice location. Thus, although not required by the legislature, this report also includes ten-year outcomes for the 2014 cohort.

When reviewing this report, it is important to keep in mind that North Carolina’s medical schools represent just one component in shaping the size and composition of our physician workforce. Physicians’ decisions about specialty choice and practice location are shaped by numerous other factors including the availability and location of residency training programs in needed specialties and geographies, loan repayment, compensation and life-style factors.

Analyses of the five-year outcomes of NC class of 2019 graduates and ten-year outcomes of NC class of 2014 graduates show:
* Of the 628 NC medical school graduates from the class of 2019, 62 (10%) were in practice or training in primary care in NC in 2024, and 5 (<1%) are in primary care in a rural NC county.
* Of the 446 NC medical school graduates from the class of 2014, 56 (13%) were practicing primary care in NC in 2024, 10 years post-graduation and 11 graduates (2.5%) were in rural primary care in NC.
* Both UNC and ECU retained the largest proportion of graduates in practice or training in NC in any specialty after five years (46% and 38%, respectively), followed by Duke (24%), Campbell (21%), Wake Forest (18%).
* UNC and ECU had the largest proportions of graduates practicing in primary care in NC five years after graduating in 2019 (17% and 15%, respectively). From this cohort, UNC contributed 29 graduates to the state primary care workforce, while Campbell contributed 14 and ECU added 11.
* Across both the 2014 and 2019 cohorts, 13 graduates were found to be practicing or training in a safety net setting.[^1]
* Three percent (19/628) of the class of 2019 and nearly five percent (21/446) of the class of 2014 worked in a practice location in the most economically distressed neighborhoods in NC five and ten years, respectively, after graduation.
* Twelve 2014 graduates were in practice in general surgery in NC ten years after graduating with one in a rural county. Five graduates from the same year were practicing psychiatry in NC ten years later with none practicing primarily in a rural county.

## Background

In 1993, the North Carolina General Assembly expressed interest in expanding the pool of generalist physicians (i.e., primary care physicians) for the state. To increase the supply, as part of N.C.S.L.1993-321 the General Assembly required each of the state's four medical schools to develop a plan to expand the percent of medical school graduates choosing residency positions in primary care. Primary care was defined as family practice, general internal medicine, general pediatric medicine, internal medicine-pediatrics, and obstetrics-gynecology. It set the goal for East Carolina University (ECU) and UNC Schools of Medicine at 60% of graduates entering primary care. For the Wake Forest University and Duke University Schools of Medicine, it set the goal at 50%. Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine graduated its first class in 2017 and was therefore not included in these original goals.

Since 1994, the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (“Sheps Center”) and the NC Area Health Education Centers program (AHEC) have collaborated to produce this report tracks the workforce outcomes for NC medical schools. As a result of the legislative mandate, NC is a national model for tracking medical student outcomes. Data from this report were featured in the New England Journal of Medicine as an example of how to track workforce outcomes in John Iglehart’s 2018 article on "The challenging quest to improve rural health care."[^2]

While not required by the original legislation, the Sheps Center and NC AHEC have enhanced the annual report to better reflect the state’s workforce needs. As in prior years, this report tracks NC medical school graduate outcomes for physicians who practice in NC and in rural NC counties. However, this report also includes an analysis of the number of medical school graduates that practice in NC safety net settings[^1] and in areas of high economic deprivation in NC. We have also included an analysis of graduates retained in psychiatry and general surgery in NC.

Historically, this report has examined NC medical school graduates at five years following graduation per the legislative mandate. However, this period is not ideal because the time required to complete residency after graduation from medical school ranges between three to six years or more. At five-years post-graduation from medical school, physicians in psychiatry, obstetrics & gynecology (ob/gyn), surgery, and medicine/pediatrics are just completing residency, or may be in fellowship/specialty training, and may not have settled in a permanent practice location. This is typically the case for general surgeons, whose training period is five years, and for ob/gyns, psychiatrists and medicine/pediatrics residents who often do a fellowship after a four-year residency. Ten years following graduation from medical school is a more reasonable timeframe to track outcomes, as it allows for fellowship training following residency. Thus, although not required by the legislature, this report also includes ten-year outcomes for the 2014 cohort. 

Since reporting on medical student outcomes began in 1994, Campbell University became the fifth medical school in North Carolina and is included in this report. The health care system has also undergone dramatic change in in the last thirty years and the data in this report remain as critical as ever to help inform the state’s efforts to address chronic shortfalls of primary care physicians, especially in rural areas. The composition of the primary care workforce itself has also changed. For example, an increasing proportion of general internal medicine physicians are subspecializing; recent national analyses found the percentage of graduating internal medicine residents planning a career in general internal medicine has declined by half in the last decade.[^3] Concurrently, the growth of hospitalists and the declining number of internal medicine physicians trained, and practicing, in community-based settings has reduced the number of primary care physicians choosing community-based primary care medicine. 

## Data Sources and Methods 

### Data Sources

Data included in this report come from several sources: 
* The North Carolina Medical Board’s annual licensure files (NCMB), maintained by the NC Health Professions Data System at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research
* GMETrack, the graduate medical education tracking file of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)
* Data from the alumni and student affairs offices at the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine, the Duke University School of Medicine, the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, and the Wake Forest University School of Medicine
* The Federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for population and core based statistical area data, which are used to determine which counties in NC are classified as metropolitan (urban) or non-metropolitan (rural). For this report, we used the July 2023 file in which 55 counties in North Carolina are rural (non-metropolitan).
* The 2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes for US census tracts in North Carolina from the US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service. Census tracts with scores of 4 or greater were considered rural, even if their county was metropolitan. This is similar to the methodology of the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy.
* The NC Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) list of safety net sites, updated in July 2024.
* The 2022 vintage of the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) produced by the University of Wisconsin Center for Health Disparities Research. We used the version of the index which is calculated relative only to areas within the state, not the entire nation. 

Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (Campbell) is not mandated to provide data for this report, as the school did not exist when the 1993 legislation was passed. However, Campbell has provided initial match data for the last several years and now has its third fiveyear cohort reported in this report.

As in prior years, this report does not emphasize the data from initial residency matches because many physicians change residency specialties, subsequently subspecialize, or change geographic location over the course of their GME training. For this reason, workforce outcomes are better measured after residency training and a report on those outcomes is forthcoming. 

### Methods 

We merged GMETrack data from the AAMC for 2014 and 2019 medical school graduates with the 2024 NCMB annual licensure file (housed with the Health Professions Data System) to determine physician practice outcomes at five or ten years post-graduation from medical school. The NCMB’s licensure data provides in-state practice locations and areas of practice, while the GMETrack data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) is the source list for graduates within a cohort. This is consistent with the methodology of this report for most of its existence; however, we used a different methodology in the last two years to account for an interruption in our access to the AAMC data.

Primary care residency specialties are defined by legislation passed by the NC General Assembly in 1993 (Senate Bill 27/ House Bill 729) and include family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatric medicine, internal medicine-pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology. Even though internal medicine-pediatrics is not reported as an area of practice by the NCMB, physicians trained in internal medicine-pediatrics typically report either pediatrics or general internal medicine as an area of practice and are therefore still captured as primary care physicians in the report.

“Primary Care” is defined for both initial specialty of residency training (identified in GMETrack data for each cohort) and for current practice or training area (identified using NCMB data for physicians in NC). As discussed above, many graduates who initially match to internal medicine and are counted as primary care for their initial match to residency training will go onto train and practice in subspecialties outside of primary care five years after graduation. Asa result, the number of medical students matching to primary care for their initial residency choice is overstated relative to the number of physicians who will end up practicing in primary care. 

Psychiatry includes physicians who report practicing in the following specialties: Psychiatry, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, Forensic Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine, Psychiatry/Geriatric, Family Medicine-Psychiatry, Internal Medicine-Psychiatry, and PediatricsPsychiatry.

General surgery includes physicians report practicing in the following specialties: General Surgery, Abdominal Surgery, Colon & Rectal Surgery, Critical Care Surgery, Head and Neck Surgery, Oncology Surgery, Pediatric Surgery, Transplant Surgery, Trauma Surgery, or Vascular Surgery. 

For safety net provider information, we geocoded both the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services safety net site list and the practice addresses in the NCMB file for each cohort. We then intersected the geocoded datasets to find potential matches between providers and sites. Potential matches were manually checked for accuracy. Safety net providers are defined as health care facilities that provide a significant level of health care and other health-related services to uninsured, Medicaid, and other vulnerable populations. These include rural health clinics, rural health centers, federally qualified health centers, free and charitable clinics, small rural hospitals, health departments, and critical access hospitals. We also used the geocoded locations to place each physician in a block group and a county, allowing us to assign each to an area deprivation index and non-metropolitan (rural) status. 

The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a measure that summarizes the socioeconomic distress of a Census block group using data from the American Community Survey.i The ADI is based on factors related to income, education, employment, and housing quality in a census block group, which is the geographic equivalent of a neighborhood, The index uses 17 different measurements across a range of domains, like “Percent of households without a motor vehicle” and “Percent of population aged >= 25 years with < a high school diploma”. The weights from a factor analysis of these variables are used to calculate a score for each block group, which is then converted to a decile ranking for each block group relative to the other block groups in the state. 

To define rural in this report, we use the US Census Bureau and US OMB’s July 2023 “Core Based Statistical Area” (CBSA) delineations and 2010 RUCA codes. In this analysis, nonmetropolitan counties include micropolitan and counties outside of CBSAs, as well as census tracts with a RUCA score of 4 or greater. The use of RUCA codes in this year’s report expands the number of areas considered rural because it includes rural Census tracts in metropolitan counties, and more closely follows the methodology of the Federal Office of Rural Health.

To report initial residency match data for 2024, we asked each of the medical schools in the state to submit aggregate match data for these recent graduates, which they provided via email.

Out of the 628 medical school graduates in 2019, 62 (10%) were in training or practice in primary care in NC in 2024 (**Figure 1**). This represents a decrease from previous years when between 12% and 17% of the most recent graduating cohorts (the classes of 2010-2018), were in training or practice in primary care in NC five years after graduating. Less than 1% (n=5) of the 2019 cohort was in primary care in a rural NC county. This also shows a decline relative to previous years when between 1% and 3% of NC medical school graduates were in practice in primary care in rural NC five years after graduating. 

A greater percentage of graduates from the state’s public medical schools are retained in NC five years after graduating, compared to the state’s private medical schools (*Figure 2*). For the class of 2019, 46% of UNC graduates and 38% of ECU graduates were practicing in state in 2024. UNC has displayed a steady increase in in-state retention since the 2017 cohort.

**Figure 3** shows the primary care practice or training outcomes for each school’s 2019 graduates. Each individual figure is a version of **Figure 1** for each school’s graduates. Very few graduates from any school are practicing primary care in a rural area, though Campbell had about 2% of their 2019 graduates practicing primary care in a rural area in North Carolina in 2024. UNC and ECU both retained at least 15% of their 2019 graduating classes in North Carolina practicing or training in primary care.

#### Practice in Safety Net Settings and Most Economically Distressed Neighborhoods

Safety net providers are defined as health care facilities that provide a significant amount of health care and other health-related services to uninsured, Medicaid, and other vulnerable populations. Four graduates from the class of 2019 were in practice in safety net settings in NC in 2024, including two UNC graduates, one ECU graduate, and one Campbell graduate. 

**Figure 4** compares the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) of the neighborhoods where physicians who were retained in North Carolina five years after graduation report their primary practice location. Low scores indicate low levels of economic distress, and high scores indicate high levels of economic distress. Three percent (19/628) of the class of 2019 worked in a practice located in the most economically distressed neighborhoods (top quintile: ADI 9 and 10) five years after graduation. 

ADI scores are not assigned for census block groups that are dominated by large facilities such as hospitals because they have so few people living these areas. ADI scores were not available for almost a third (31%, n=58/186) of the graduating class of 2019 who were still in North Carolina because their primary practice location was a large facility, most likely a hospital, which makes sense as many of these physicians are likely still in training.

**Figures 4, 5, and 6** display only individuals who were licensed in North Carolina in 2024. While North Carolina graduates may be practicing in distressed areas or in needed areas of practice in other states, this report specifically focuses on service within North Carolina. Consequently, the 442 graduates (70% of the total class) who were practicing or training in another state, or who were not licensed in NC in 2024, are excluded from these charts. However, the percentages shown in the figures represent each group's proportion of the total 2019 graduating class of 628 students, not just those who remained in North Carolina. As a result, the percentages across all categories total only 30% rather than 100%.

#### Retention in Primary Care and Psychiatry Areas of Practice

**Figure 5** displays the outcomes for 2019 graduates by area of practice. Physicians report a primary area of practice to the NCMB each year of licensure. A physician’s primary area of practice can differ from their training specialty. The category “Other Area of Practice” includes all other specialties, including, for example, dermatology, hospitalist, and ophthalmology.

### Class of 2014 Five Year Outcomes 

We also tracked 2014 graduates of NC medical schools to determine where graduates were ten years following graduation from medical school. As noted previously, ten years post-graduation from medical school allows time for physicians to complete residency and fellowship training and settle into practice. A higher percentage of graduates are in primary care practice in rural areas ten years after graduation compared to five years after. This may indicate that some NC graduates do a residency out-of-state and then return to practice in NC or that some of the efforts currently underway to encourage medical students to practice in NC take a while to take effect but perhaps are starting to do so.

**Figure 7** illustrates the aggregate outcome of North Carolina’s medical school graduates ten years after graduation in 2014. The total number of graduates in 2014 is much lower than in 2019, because Campbell had not yet graduated its first class.

The retention of primary care providers for each school’s 2014 graduates is illustrated in **Figure 8**. One third (n = 26) of 2014 ECU graduates were practicing primary care in North Carolina in 2024.

#### Practice in Safety Net Settings and Most Economically Distressed Neighborhoods

Nine graduates from the class of 2014 were in practice in safety net settings in North Carolina in 2024, including five UNC graduates, three Wake Forest graduates, and one ECU graduate. This was a greater number than the 2019 cohort. While it would be hard to draw conclusions from these small numbers, it is possible that individuals are still in training at five years, which would typically be at a larger medical center, instead of a safety net setting.

**Figure 9** compares the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) of the neighborhoods in North Carolina where physicians from the class of 2014 report their primary practice location in 2024. Almost five percent (n=21/446) of the class of 2014 worked in a practice location in the most economically distressed neighborhoods (top quintile) ten years after graduation. As with the 2019 cohort, note the large proportion of graduates for whom an ADI score is not available because their practice location is a major facility. Of course, depending on the location and type of facility, many of these graduates will also be serving many economically distressed patients.

**Figures 9, 10, and 11** display only individuals who were licensed in North Carolina in 2024. While graduates from this cohort may be practicing in distressed areas or in needed areas of practice in other states, this report specifically focuses on service within North Carolina. Consequently, the 255 graduates (57% of the total class) who were practicing or training in another state, or who were not licensed in NC in 2024, are excluded from these charts. However, the percentages shown in the figures represent each group's proportion of the total graduating class of 446 students, not just those who remained in North Carolina. As a result, the percentages across all categories total only 43% , rather than 100%.

#### Practice in Safety Net Settings and Most Economically Distressed Neighborhoods

**Figure 10** shows outcomes for 2014 graduates who are in North Carolina and have a primary care area of practice, or who are practicing psychiatry or general surgery. The outcomes for general surgery are reported here for the 2014 cohort, but not for the 2019 cohort, because general surgery residencies typically last five years, and many general surgeons complete a subspecialty fellowship afterwards. For this reason, reporting on general surgery practice outcomes at five-years post-graduation may be misleading.

Figure 2 shows the number and percent of residents retained in NC and practicing in rural areas in NC. Internal medicine (IM) is the largest of the high need specialties in NC with a total of 569 residents graduating between 2017 and 2019; 39% of these graduates were retained in state and 2% were in active practice in rural areas five years after graduating. Part of the reason for their lower retention rate relative to other specialties is that IM residents are more likely to pursue further subspecialty training, which may draw them away from the state and out of general internal medicine. Half (50%) of family medicine residents were retained in NC and 11% were in practice in rural areas of NC five years after graduating. Other specialties - pediatrics, general surgery, ob-gyn, psychiatry and internal medicine/pediatrics vary in workforce retention outcomes with general surgery residents having the lowest retention rate in NC five years after graduation (30%) compared to other specialties examined in this report. Psychiatry programs had the lowest rural retention with only 1% of residents in practice in rural areas five years after graduation.

Figure 3 uses a Sankey diagram to show subspecialization rates among NC residents graduating from generalist training programs five years after graduation. IM physicians had the highest subspecialization rates with 72% not retained in general internal medicine, including 16% of general IM residents who became hospitalists and 56% who were practicing in other subspecialties, including IM subspecialties five years after graduation. Nearly half (47%) of general surgeons were not in general surgery five years after graduation, and 38% of general pediatricians were not practicing as general pediatricians. By contrast, only 11% of family medicine residents were not practicing as family medicine physicians and all psychiatrist trainees remained in psychiatry five years after graduating from residency training.

Figure 4 shows the number of residents retained in NC and in rural NC areas by sponsoring institution of GME training. Over the three cohorts, Duke University Hospitals produced the most residency graduates in NC (1,029 graduates), followed by University of North Carolina Hospitals (800) and Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Centers (705). Because these data are aggregated to the sponsoring institution level, these figures include residents training at both at the sponsoring institution, as well as other sites where training occurs for that institution.

Figure 5 shows the same data as Figure 4 but by percentage of the graduating class. Residencies sponsored by the Mountain Area Health Education Center (MAHEC) and the Southern Regional Area Health Education Center retain the largest percentage of their residents retained in rural areas of NC. MAHEC retains 41% of its graduates in NC and 26% of its graduates in rural areas five years after graduation. Southern Regional AHEC retains 56.5% of its graduates and 26.1% of its graduates in rural areas. Among the larger residencies (greater than 100 graduates across all three cohorts), the University of North Carolina Hospitals retains the greatest percentage in-state at 46%, followed by Carolinas Medical Center (45.8%) and ECU Health Medical Center (36.1%).

Another way to look at the outcomes for NC residency graduates is to examine how many are practicing in areas with underserved populations. About 1% (34) of residency graduates were in active practice at a safety net facility as defined by NC DHHS. Residents who completed a family medicine residency represented two-thirds of these physicians. The data reveal that 168 (4.6%) residency graduates were found to be in active practice in neighborhoods in the top quintile of the area deprivation index (i.e. most deprived places).

Of the 3,606 physicians who graduated from a NC residency program in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the majority (82%) graduated from an out-of-state medical school (Figure 6). Physicians who attended both an NC medical school and an NC residency have higher retention rates in NC. Across the 2017, 2018, and 2019 cohorts, 648 residency graduates also graduated from an NC medical school and five years later, 64.5% of these 648 physicians were actively practicing in NC and 4.8% were practicing in rural NC. By comparison, the retention of out of state medical school graduates with NC GME training was 31.1%.

{{< img title="**Figure 6.** Medical School Location of Physicians Graduating from an NC Residency in 2017, 2018, and 2019" src="/images/posts/gme-tracking-2025/figure-6.png" alt="Diagram illustrating the number of NC residency graduates who graduated from an NC medical school vs an out-of-state medical school.">}}

Figure 7 shows the retention rates for these "double NC graduates" by residency specialty. Almost 90% of NC family medicine residency graduates who also attended an NC medical school were retained in practice in NC five years later, and 20% were in active practice in rural NC. While the overall numbers are much smaller for psychiatry and IM/pediatrics residents, those who graduated from an NC medical school also exhibited high in-state retention rates.

## Conclusion

Understanding trends in the retention of residents trained in the state is important to assess the return on investment of public funds spent on training and to assess whether the training capacity in the state is sufficient to maintain or increase the supply of physicians in the state to meet evolving health care needs of NC. North Carolina is one of the few states that systematically reports workforce retention outcomes for all medical students and residents trained in-state using a cohort-based approach. By reporting outcomes at the specialty level in addition to the institutional level, the data reveal significant variation in the proportion of graduates who remain in NC to practice, particularly in rural areas and in high need specialties. This level of granularity provides valuable insights for workforce planning and policy development.

As policy makers consider ways to increase the number of physicians practicing in NC, it is important to have data on which GME programs are retaining their graduates in NC, in needed specialties and in rural areas. Physicians are increasingly subspecializing and fewer are practicing in "generalist" specialties such as family medicine, general IM, general pediatrics, general surgery, and general psychiatry. Increasing rates of specialization among IM physicians[^12], pediatricians[^13] and general surgeons[^14][^15] limits the availability of generalist health care services to NC's population. While the state needs subspecialists, maintaining an adequate supply of generalist physicians is necessary to meet demand for primary care, mental health, obstetric and gynecological care, child health, and general surgery services. The data in this report suggest that family medicine GME programs in NC, especially those that recruit trainees who completed medical school in-state, have high retention rates in NC in generalist practice and in rural communities.

We used a cohort approach for this analysis because it matches the approach used in the 2018 GME tracking report[^16] and the consistent methodology allows policy makers to evaluate whether the workforce outcomes of NC's GME programs change over time. Compared to those previous analyses, retention rates have decreased. The 2018 report showed that 43% of graduates who completed GME training between 2008 and 2011 remained in NC; this report showed that percentage had declined to 37% of residents graduating in 2017-2019. There were also differences in retention for specialties in this current analysis compared to 2008-2011. Specifically, there was a decrease in the in-state retention for psychiatry from 57.3% to 33.9% and surgery from 37.1% to 29.5% between the earlier 2008-2011 cohort residents graduating in 2017-2019. In contrast, the in-state retention rate for pediatrics increased from 44.3% to 45.7% and the in-state retention for ob-gyn increased from 34.5% to 40.3%. Also, family medicine graduates in the current report were much more likely to be practicing in rural NC compared to the previous report (10.8% vs 4.8%). Further analyses are needed to explore why this occurred.

While study findings found an increase in NC trained residents practicing in rural areas in 2017-2019 compared to 2008-2011, there continues to be a gap between the supply of physicians in rural NC counties compared to metropolitan ones. A recent analysis[^17] released by the Sheps Center found that 24 North Carolina counties did not have a sufficient number of primary care clinicians and that 174 additional primary care clinician FTEs would be needed to bring these counties to the threshold for primary care sufficiency. As the state considers ways to increase residency training in NC by investing in new programs or expanding the capacity of existing programs, policy makers may want to review how other states have implemented accountability measures to assess the return on investment of programs in producing physicians practicing in rural and underserved areas. One state model to consider is Missouri. In 2023, The Missouri General Assembly used state appropriations to fund the expansion of primary care and psychiatry residencies in the state. Selection criteria for these expansion funds include a priority for GME programs that have a proven track record of retaining residents in state and in rural practice after graduation.[^18]

This analysis did not account for the fact that residents, particularly those in specialties like family medicine, may have training experience in rural areas or underserved communities during residency and that this exposure contributes to their higher likelihood of rural practice and practice in safety net settings after graduation. A recent study by Hawes et al. measured trends in the number of medical residency training sites in rural and federally qualified health center (FQHC) settings, using data from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.[^19] That study showed that the number of residency programs with training in rural areas increased as a result of federal investments in GME through the Teaching Health Center GME and Rural Residency Planning and Development programs. Future analyses could potentially access ACGME data to look at outcomes at the site level and examine how programs with greater rural training are more likely to produce physicians who practice in NC's rural areas.
