## Introduction

North Carolina (NC) is projected to face a shortage of almost 12,500 registered nurses (RNs) by 2033.[^1] A 2023 survey of more than 1,000 NC health care facilities and 80 education programs conducted by the NC Health Talent Alliance found that 1 in 6 RN positions in the state were unfilled.[^2] Nationwide, RN staffing intensity (the ratio of RNs to other nursing personnel) in hospitals has decreased since 2021, consistent with findings from Auerbach et al. (2024) which suggest that although overall nurse supply in the United States is increasing, most of the growth is taking place outside of hospitals.[^3]

A recent report by NSI Nursing Solutions (2025) estimated a cost of $61,110 for turnover of one bedside nurse and a three-month timeframe to recruit an experienced RN.[^4] However, research by Jones (2008) estimated an even higher cost of nurse turnover, ranging from $82,000 to $88,000 depending on RN experience.[^5] Although estimates of the cost of nurse turnover vary depending on the methodology used, nurse turnover is costly and hiring a new RN is time consuming.[^6] Factors associated with nurse turnover include burnout, insufficient staffing, inadequate compensation and benefits, lack of professional development opportunities, issues with workplace culture and management, safety concerns, and health/mental health related concerns.[^7][^8] In NC, a recent analysis examining exits from the NC RN workforce found that the percent of nurses who left the workforce increased from 13.9% in 2019 to 15.1% in 2023.[^9] Given the cost associated with nurse turnover, this increase in exits from the NC RN workforce requires attention.[^10] 

International calls have been made to prioritize programs and strategies to recruit and retain nurses in the workforce.[^11][^12][^13] Within NC, the 2024 NC Institute of Medicine (NCIOM) nursing workforce report[^14] outlined several strategies to sustain and retain nurses in the NC workforce, including strategies that can be implemented within nursing units and more broadly at the organizational level: 
- identifying opportunities for nurses to participate in educational advancement, leadership, mentoring, and preceptorship
- decreasing the experience of high workload and documentation burden for nurses 
- strengthening nurse transition to practice efforts and early career development across all care delivery settings
- protecting nurses from violence in the workplace
- increasing awareness and support for the mental health of nurses
- creating robust systems that involve nurses as leaders in decision making
This brief summarizes the results of a review of systematic reviews focused on nursing retention interventions that have been quantitatively evaluated. In this brief, we summarize findings from the literature on retention interventions and discuss their implications for NC RN workforce partners such as employers, policy makers, NC AHEC, and the NC Center on the Workforce for Health, who have an interest in promoting methods to retain the NC nursing workforce.

## Methods

This review focused on systematic reviews and meta-analyses in English published after 2020 that quantitatively measured nursing turnover, intention to stay or leave, and retention. The research team, which included a health sciences librarian, conducted literature searches in CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCOhost), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, and Scopus (Elsevier) using multiple relevant subject headings (e.g., “healthcare worker retention” or “turnover”) and key words (e.g., “retention,” and “interventions,” AND “nurse”). The original searches yielded 1,453 articles which were reviewed by the research team. First, two researchers independently screened the titles and abstracts for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were included if: 1) the study subjects included nurses; 2) the intervention’s purpose focused on nurse retention; 3) the study’s context was within healthcare; 4) and the outcomes included a quantitative measurement of retention. Exclusion criteria applied included: 1) systematic reviews that included qualitative-only research; 2) scoping reviews; 3) studies on students 4) studies on graduate nurses (not yet licensed); 5) studies on nursing faculty; 6) studies on advanced practice registered nurses; 7) and studies on more than one healthcare clinician. Next, the same researchers independently screened 17 full-text references for inclusion and resolved any discrepancies through discussion. The final sample included six systematic reviews published between 2020 and 2024. The research team extracted data from each review including author(s) name, year of publication, review objective, setting type, level of intervention (unit-level or organizational-level), number of quantitative studies that measured retention, measure(s) of retention, and findings.  

## Findings

The final sample of six reviews[^15][^16][^17][^18][^19][^20] represent 67 studies that measured nurse turnover, intention to stay or leave, and retention. While all reviews included studies of nurse outcomes in hospitals, only one review (Mohamed & Al-Hmaimat, 2024) included a study of retention in long term care settings.21 Retention was not consistently measured or reported across studies in the reviews. Measures of retention included turnover intention, intention to leave, and intention to stay using a variety of validated and researcher-created survey tools (Table 1).
