## Introduction

With rising concerns about the number of health care workers exiting the workforce and health workforce shortages emerging across the United States[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2], efforts to reengage individuals who have left the workforce are needed to facilitate re-entry and increase clinician supply to meet patient demand.[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4]<sup>,</sup>[^5] Healthcare professionals exit the workforce for a variety of reasons (e.g., family or medical leave, career change and burnout)[^6]<sup>,</sup>[^7] and these breaks can result in a lapse of their licensure and deficiencies in the theoretical and clinical knowledge necessary to deliver high quality clinical care if they choose to return to the workforce.  

While North Carolina (NC) specific data on the proportion of the healthcare workforce that has exited and subsequently reentered the workforce are not currently available, recent data on employer vacancy rates and workforce exit are available for nurses. The statewide Health Talent Alliance report found a 15% vacancy rate for RNs across North Carolina employers in 2024.[^8] A recent analysis from Sheps Health Workforce NC found an increase in the number of RNs who exited the workforce from 2016 (13.9% exit rate) to 2023 (15.1% exit rate).[^9] Taken together, these data on RNs suggest that re-engaging healthcare workers who have exited the workforce may be an effective strategy for reducing healthcare workforce vacancy rates, and this approach may have relevance for other healthcare professions facing similar workforce challenges. 
Specific programs are available for healthcare workers who wish to reenter the workforce (i.e., reenter after a period of extended leave, typically resulting in a lapse in license). Refresher programs serve as ways to facilitate workforce reentry into clinical practice. The process of reentering the workforce through a refresher program may include the following:  1) a clinical skills assessment; 2) updating knowledge and skills to meet current licensure and clinical requirements (may include preceptorship, didactics, case reviews, EHR training, or simulation-based skills training); 3) documentation of continuing education requirements; 4) the professional licensure board reinstatement process; 5) reentry into practice with a practice and supervision plan. The success of refresher programs is typically measured by program completion, the reinstatement of the clinician’s license, and reentry back into the workforce. 
This report aims to assist workforce stakeholders in NC to better understand how to reengage healthcare workers who have exited the workforce. We conducted a systematic literature review on strategies to reengage healthcare workers. In this report we summarize: 1) the identified barriers and facilitators to reengaging healthcare workers who have left the workforce; 2) key elements of existing reengagement programs; 3) high-level barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers reengaging in the workforce and in current refresher programs; 4) key elements of refresher programs to consider; and, 5) how this report’s findings could be applied to NC-specific policy interventions.

## Methods

We searched CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCOhost), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, and Scopus (Elsevier) databases using subject headings (e.g., “healthcare worker reentry” and “refresher programs” and key words “re-enter,” “return-to-work,” AND “physician,” “nurse”). The final sample of our systematic literature review included 39 articles, and Table 1 describes the article extraction process. Of the 39 articles, 26 examined reengagement practices internationally and 13 were based in the United States. Sixteen (16) articles described reengagement practices (Table 3) while the other 23 studies described the facilitators and barriers to reengaging various professions of the health workforce. Overarching facilitators and barriers to workforce reengagement at various levels (clinician-level, organizational-level and systemic/policy-level) identified in this review are outlined in Table 2.

Table 3 summarizes the interventions for reengagement (N=16); these interventions covered reentry into both clinical practice in hospital settings and outpatient/community-based settings. Of the 16 articles, 12 articles outlined refresher programs for different clinician types including certified nurse midwives (n=1), registered nurses (n=3), physicians (n=5), and a variety of clinicians (n=3); one article outlined a physician reentry preceptorship program; two articles outlined programs specific to reengagement following parental leave; and one article outlined established policies in the workplace for clinician reentry. 
Overall, the refresher programs included both didactic and clinical skills components, with the majority of time spent on clinical skills. Some programs included simulation labs, both during the course or at the completion of the course to assess overall skill development. In the case of participants who needed additional clinical skills training before reentering practice, one program offered simulation labs for further training. Some courses offered a general curriculum for all enrolled participants, while other programs tailored the clinical skills component of the program to the learning needs of participants.

The review of these 12 articles yielded several key considerations for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of a refresher program (Figure 1). Important factors include the overall cost of the program to both the administering organization and the participant, as well as the duration and any mitigating circumstances that may affect its length. The findings also highlight the importance of considering wrap-around support to facilitate successful reintegration into the workforce. Finally, robust evaluation strategies should be considered, including metrics such as program completion rates, employment outcomes, changes in licensure status, and long-term retention in the healthcare workforce following reentry.

This report provides an overview of the barriers and facilitators to reengaging healthcare workers into the workforce through refresher programs. Key elements of reengagement programs, and the barriers, facilitators, and factors affecting reengagement program success. North Carolina faces growing health workforce shortages, exacerbated by high vacancy rates and burnout.[^8]<sup>,</sup>[^9] This presents an important opportunity for NC Workforce Stakeholders (e.g., employers, educators, licensure bodies and other partners) to collaborate to develop mechanisms to reengage healthcare workers who have left the workforce. NC AHEC, for example, already plays a key role in supporting the infrastructure and facilitating the partnerships needed to support reentry education, clinical training, and career pathways for registered nurses. Table 5 outlines potential policy interventions to support the recruitment and reengagement of former healthcare workers back into the workforce.
