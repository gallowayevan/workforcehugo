Sheps Health Workforce NC provides timely, objective data and analysis to inform health workforce policy in North Carolina and across the United States. We are based at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services at UNC-Chapel Hill, but our mission is statewide, a collaboration between the Sheps Center, NC AHEC and the health professions licensing boards.
