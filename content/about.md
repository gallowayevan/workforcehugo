  The North Carolina Health Professions Data System (HPDS) collects and disseminates descriptive data on selected licensed health professionals in North Carolina.  With annual files dating back to 1979, [the HPDS is the oldest continuous state health workforce data system in the country](/hpds-history).
  
  The HPDS is maintained by the Program on Health Workforce Research and Policy at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in collaboration with the [North Carolina Area Health Education Centers Program (AHEC)](https://www.ncahec.net/), and the [stateâ€™s independent health professional licensing boards](/licensing-boards). Ongoing financial support is provided by the NC AHEC Program Office and the Office of the Provost at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Although the NC HPDS maintains the data system, the data remain the property of their respective licensing board.
