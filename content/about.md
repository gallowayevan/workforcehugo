Sheps Health Workforce NC provides timely, objective data and analysis to inform health workforce policy in North Carolina and across the United States. We are based at the [Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/) at UNC-Chapel Hill, but our mission is statewide, a collaboration between the Sheps Center, the [North Carolina Area Health Education Centers Program (AHEC)](https://www.ncahec.net/), and the health professions licensing boards.

We manage the North Carolina Health Professions Data System (HPDS), collecting and disseminating descriptive data on selected licensed health professionals in North Carolina.  With annual files dating back to 1979, [the HPDS is the oldest continuous state health workforce data system in the country](/hpds-history).

 Ongoing financial support is provided by the NC AHEC Program Office and the Office of the Provost at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Although we maintain the data system, the data remain the property of their respective licensing board.
